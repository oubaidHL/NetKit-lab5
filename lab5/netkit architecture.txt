PC1:

ip address 172.16.1.10 255.255.255.240
default-gateway 172.16.1.1


PC2:

ip address 172.16.1.11 255.255.255.240

Router 1:

interface P1
ip address 172.16.1.1 255.255.255.240

interface P2
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0



Router 2:

interface P1
ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0

interface P2
ip address 192.168.42.2 255.255.255.0



Architecture:

PC1 is connected to P1 of s1 (Switch 1)
PC2 is connected to P2 of s1 (Switch 1)
P3 of s1 (Switch 1) is connected to P1 of r1 (Router 1)
P2 of r1 (Router 1) is connected to P1 of s2 (Switch 2)
P2 of s2 (Switch 2) is connected to PC3
P3 of s2 (Switch 2) is connected to P1 of r2 (Router 2)
P2 of r2 (Router 2) is connected to the Internet network with IP 192.168.42.1

PC1 ------> P1 of s1 (Switch 1) -------> P3 of s1 (Switch 1) -------> P1 of r1 (Router 1) -------> P2 of r1 (Router 1) -------> P1 of s2 (Switch 2)

PC2 ------> P2 of s1 (Switch 1) -------> P3 of s1 (Switch 1) -------> P1 of r1 (Router 1) -------> P2 of r1 (Router 1) -------> P1 of s2 (Switch 2)

PC3 <------ P2 of s2 (Switch 2) <------- P3 of s2 (Switch 2) <------- P1 of r2 (Router 2) <------- P2 of r2 (Router 2) <------- Internet (192.168.42.0/24)

PC1 and PC2 are on the same subnet and are connected to Switch 1, which is then connected to Router 1. PC3 is on a different subnet and is connected to Switch 2, which is then connected to Router 2.

Router 1 has two interfaces: P1, which is connected to Switch 1, and P2, which is connected to Switch 2. Router 2 has two interfaces: P1, which is connected to Switch 2, and P2, which is connected to the Internet network with IP 192.168.42.1.

The routing between the subnets can be done by the routers using a routing protocol or static routes. The default gateways for PC1 and PC2 are set to 172.16.1.1, which is the IP address of the interface P1 on Router 1. The default gateway for PC3 is set to 192.168.1.1, which is the IP address of the interface P1 on Router 1.
